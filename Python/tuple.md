Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
A tuple is a collection which is ordered and **unchangeable**.
```python
mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
```

Are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are [[list]], [[set]], and [[dict]], all with different qualities and usage.
